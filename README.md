### The mind without weights.

**A reasoning engine grounded in a _vector-symbolic architecture_ and
_instance-based memory_ — not in billions of trained parameters.**

No weights. No gradients. No training loop. No neural network. No GPU.

`Deterministic` · `Auditable` · `CPU-only`

## ✦ Retrieval and reasoning, one search

Two questions, asked of every query — and Sema answers both in a single pass:

<div align="center">

|                  | The question it asks                                 |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔎 **Retrieval** | _"What do I already know that bears on this?"_       |
| 🧠 **Deduction** | _"What can I conclude or decide from what I found?"_ |

</div>

```text
               ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
Your question  │"The Weeping Woman was painted by Picasso."   │
               └──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                                      ▼
   🔎  Retrieve     resonate the query against the memory
                    ·  "… painted by … → the painter"  (a learned pattern)
                    ·  "Picasso → co-founded the Cubist movement"
                                      ▼
   🧠  Deduce       connect · derive · compose
                    ·  lift the painter from a sentence never seen
                    ·  follow that name onward to what it implies
                                      ▼
   ✅  Answer       "Pablo Picasso co-founded the Cubist movement"
                    (a fact that appears in no word of the question)
```

Retrieval and reasoning are not two bolted-together stages — they are **one
search** over **one memory**, which is why the answer can be something no single
stored fact contains. Watch it happen below.

---

## ✦ Why Sema

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧩 Symbolic, not statistical

Knowledge is stored as a **content-addressed graph**, not smeared across a
weight matrix. Every fact is an edge you can point at. Nothing is hallucinated
out of a probability distribution.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔀 Retrieval and reasoning, unified

Retrieval and reasoning are **one mechanism**, not a brittle pipeline of bolted-
together components. A query enters the graph where it _resonates_ and a single
lightest-derivation search composes the answer.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔍 Fully auditable

Every answer is a **derivation** over explicit facts. No black box. Trace any
output back to the exact deposits that produced it — a hard requirement for
regulated, high-stakes, and safety-critical deployments.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ♻️ Deterministic & reproducible

Same seed + same bytes → **identical result, every time.** No temperature, no
sampling, no drift between runs. Reproducibility is a property of the
architecture, not a flag you toggle.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ⚡ Instant training

Training **is** depositing — one pass, no epochs, no gradient descent, no
fine-tuning jobs. Teach it a fact and it knows the fact. Now.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Total data sovereignty

Runs entirely on **your** hardware. No API calls, no telemetry, no weights to
leak. Everything a trained mind knows lives in a few files on your disk.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> **No GPU. No cluster. No cloud bill.** Sema runs on an ordinary CPU with a
> tiny memory footprint, because it never multiplies a weight matrix — it walks
> a graph. The economics of deploying intelligence change completely.

## ✦ See it think

Give Sema four plain notes — the way you'd jot them down — then ask things **no
note answers**. From three worked examples it learns the _shape_ of "X was
painted by Y", lifts the painter out of a sentence it has **never seen**, and —
in the same pass — reasons onward to a separate fact about that painter. The
reply contains no word from the question: it is **retrieval, generalization, and
reasoning composing as a single act**.

```ts
// demo.ts — one short session that drives the WHOLE pipeline from one memory.
//
// We give Sema a handful of plain notes, then ask things that no single note
// answers. The headline query is the third one: from three worked examples Sema
// learns the shape of "X was painted by Y", lifts the painter out of a sentence
// it has NEVER seen, and then — in the same pass — reasons forward to a separate
// fact about that painter. The reply contains no word from the question. That is
// retrieval, generalization, and reasoning composing as a single act, with every
// step traceable back to the notes behind it.

import { Mind } from "../src/index.js";
import { SQliteStore } from "../src/store-sqlite.js";

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const mind = new Mind({ store: new SQliteStore({ path: ":memory:" }) });
  const ask = async (q: string) => (await mind.respondText(q)).trim();

  // ── Jot down what we know. Each line is just (context → what follows). ──
  await mind.ingest([
    // One relation, shown three times — a pattern taught purely by example:
    ["The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.", "Leonardo da Vinci"],
    ["The Starry Night was painted by Vincent van Gogh.", "Vincent van Gogh"],
    [
      "The Night Watch was painted by Rembrandt van Rijn.",
      "Rembrandt van Rijn",
    ],
    // One stray fact, keyed on a name none of the examples mention:
    ["Pablo Picasso", "Pablo Picasso co-founded the Cubist movement"],
  ]);

  // 1) GENERALIZE — apply the learned pattern to an unseen sentence and read out
  //    the painter. "Pablo Picasso" was never given as an answer; Sema locates it
  //    by analogy to the three examples.
  console.log(await ask("The Weeping Woman was painted by Pablo Picasso."));
  // → "Pablo Picasso co-founded the Cubist movement"
  //   …and, having found the painter, it KEEPS GOING: the name bridges into the
  //   one fact it holds about him. The answer appears in no word of the question.

  // 2) COMPUTE — exact arithmetic, grounded right where the notes go silent.
  console.log(await ask("a museum charges 12*4 for a family ticket"));
  // → "48"

  await mind.store.close();
}

main();
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is **[example/demo.ts](example/demo.ts)**, verbatim — run it yourself
> with `npm run demo`. Look closely at the first answer: the question names a
> painting Sema was never shown and asks nothing explicit, yet the reply is a
> fact about Picasso that appears **nowhere** in the question. Sema generalized
> "_painted by_" from three examples to recognize _Pablo Picasso_ as the answer
> slot, then followed that name to the one thing it knows about him — retrieval,
> an analogy, and a reasoning hop, in one query. The second answer is exact, not
> a plausible-looking guess. Every step traces back to the four notes above.

## ✦ Engineered from three solved problems

Sema is composed of three self-contained, independently documented engines. They
are fully decoupled — Sema reaches them only through interfaces.

| Engine            | What it solves                                                                             | Result                                                                                                                       |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`rabitq-hnsw`** | _"Given a vector, find the nodes whose gist resonates with it — fast, at scale, on disk."_ | HNSW over 1-bit RaBitQ codes · ~32× compression · bounded RAM · sub-linear queries                                           |
| **`derive`**      | _"Explore a huge implicit space of derivations and return the single lightest one."_       | adapted A\*LD (adapted A\* Lightest Derivation) over a weighted deduction hypergraph — Sema's thinking _is_ one call to this |
| **`alu`**         | _"Compute, exactly and symbolically, the things that are rules, not facts."_               | A tiny irreducible kernel from which arithmetic, logic, and n-dimensional computation are derived                            |
